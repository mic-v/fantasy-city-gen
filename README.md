## Fantasy CityGen
Fantasy CityGen is a tool to generate fantasy cities ranging from small towns to large cities which include generated buildings, people and population, government systems, etc. This tool is used to help create a living breathing city for fantasy worlds, perfect for games such as Dungeons & Dragons.

## Inspiration
I was inspired to make this tool through hosting my very first Dungeons & Dragons campaign. I wanted a tool to help me generate a map that my players could visualise and I stumbled into [Fantasy Town Generator](https://www.fantasytowngenerator.com/) and [Medieval Fantasy City Generator](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator). 

Both of these tools are great, however I needed a mix of both of these tools to create the perfect tool for me. Fantasy Town Generator can generate cities but it is hard to edit buildings after the map is generated. Medieval Fantasy City Generator allows to edit the map after it is generated, but this generator does not generate people that can potentially be buildings, factions, manually edit district names, etc. 

Thus Fantasy CityGen was created because I personally felt that both of these tools can combined for the perfect tool any world builder can use.
